# Block

> ### `Description`
>
> Refers to computer files that store transaction data.  
> These blocks are arranged in a linear sequence that forms an endless chain of blocks - hence, the term blockchain.  
> Every newly generated block is connected to the previous one through the use of cryptographic techniques.

> ### `Genesis Block`
>
> The first ever block recorded on its respective blockchain network, also occasionally referred to as Block 0 or Block 1.
>
> When a block is broadcasted to the blockchain, it references the previous block. However, in the case of the genesis block, there is no previous block to reference.

> ### `Block Height`
>
> Represents the number of blocks that were confirmed in the entire history of a particular blockchain network - from the genesis block (or block zero) until the most recent one.  
> So the block height of the genesis block is #0, and the block height of the first block mined is #1.
