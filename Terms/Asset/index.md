# Asset

> ### `Description`
>
> Any resource owned or controlled by a business or an economic entity

> ### `Financial Asset`
>
> A non-physical asset whose value is derived from a contractual claim, such as bank deposits, bonds, and participations in companies' share capital

> ### `Non Financial Asset`
>
> An asset that cannot be traded on the financial markets and whose value is derived by its physical net worth rather than from a contractual claim, as opposed to a financial asset (e.g., stock, bonds). Non-financial assets may be tangible (also known as real assets, e.g., land, buildings, equipment, and vehicles) but also intangible (e.g., patents, intellectual property, data)
